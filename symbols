List of logic symbols

 This article contains logic symbols. Without proper rendering support, you may
 see question marks, boxes, or other symbols instead of logic symbols.

See also: Logical connective

In logic, a set of symbols is commonly used to express logical representation.
As logicians are familiar with these symbols, they are not explained each time
they are used. So, for students of logic, the following table lists many common
symbols together with their name, pronunciation and related field of
mathematics. Additionally, the third column contains an informal definition,
and the fourth column gives a short example.

Be aware that, outside of logic, different symbols have the same meaning, and
the same symbol has, depending on the context, different meanings.

[edit] Advanced and rarely used logical symbols

These symbols are sorted by their Unicode value:

  • U+00B7 ·​ middle dot, an outdated way for denoting AND^[citation needed],
    still in use in electronics; for example "A·B" is the same as "A&B"
  • ·: Center dot with a line above it (using HTML style). Outdated way for
    denoting NAND, for example "A·B" is the same as "A NAND B" or "A|B" or "¬(A
    & B)". See also Unicode U+22C5 ⋅​ dot operator.

  • U+0305  ̅ ​ combining overline, used as abbreviation for standard numerals.
    For example, using HTML style "4̅" is a shorthand for the standard numeral
    "SSSS0".
  • Overline, is also a rarely used format for denoting Gödel numbers, for
    example "AVB" says the Gödel number of "(AVB)"
  • Overline is also an outdated way for denoting negation, still in use in
    electronics; for example "AVB" is the same as "¬(AVB)"

  • U+2191 ↑​ upwards arrow or U+007C |​ vertical line: Sheffer stroke, the
    sign for the NAND operator.
  • U+2201 ∁​ complement
  • U+2204 ∄​ there does not exist: strike out existential quantifier same as
    "¬∃"
  • U+2234 ∴​ therefore
  • U+2235 ∵​ because
  • U+22A7 ⊧​ models: is a model of
  • U+22A8 ⊨​ true: is true of
  • U+22AC ⊬​ does not prove: negated ⊢, the sign for "does not prove", for
    example T ⊬ P says "P is not a theorem of T"
  • U+22AD ⊭​ not true: is not true of
  • U+22BC ⊼​ nand: another NAND operator, can also be rendered as ∧
  • U+22BD ⊽​ nor: another NOR operator, can also be rendered as V
  • U+22C4 ⋄​ diamond operator: modal operator for "it is possible that", "it
    is not necessarily not" or rarely "it is not provable not" (in most modal
    logics it is defined as "¬◻¬")
  • U+22C6 ⋆​ star operator: usually used for ad-hoc operators
  • U+22A5 ⊥​ up tack or U+2193 ↓​ downwards arrow: Webb-operator or Peirce
    arrow, the sign for NOR. Confusingly, "⊥" is also the sign for
    contradiction or absurdity.

  • U+2310 ⌐​ reversed not sign

  • U+231C ⌜​ top left corner and U+231D ⌝​ top right corner: corner quotes,
    also called "Quine quotes"; the standard symbol used for denoting Gödel
    number; for example "⌜G⌝" denotes the Gödel number of G. (Typographical
    note: although the quotes appears as a "pair" in unicode (231C and 231D),
    they are not symmetrical in some fonts. And in some fonts (for example
    Arial) they are only symmetrical in certain sizes. Alternatively the quotes
    can be rendered as ⌈ and ⌉ (U+2308 and U+2309) or by using a negation
    symbol and a reversed negation symbol ⌐ ¬ in superscript mode. )

  • U+25FB ◻​ white medium square or U+25A1 □​ white square: modal operator for
    "it is necessary that" (in modal logic), or "it is provable that" (in
    provability logic), or "it is obligatory that" (in deontic logic), or "it
    is believed that" (in doxastic logic).

Note that the following operators are rarely supported by natively installed
fonts. If you wish to use these in a web page, you should always embed the
necessary fonts so the page viewer can see the web page without having the
necessary fonts installed in their computer.

  • U+27E1 ⟡​ white concave-sided diamond
  • U+27E2 ⟢​ white concave-sided diamond with leftwards tick: modal operator
    for was never
  • U+27E3 ⟣​ white concave-sided diamond with rightwards tick: modal operator
    for will never be
  • U+27E4 ⟤​ white square with leftwards tick: modal operator for was always
  • U+27E5 ⟥​ white square with rightwards tick: modal operator for will always
    be
  • U+297D ⥽​ right fish tail: sometimes used for "relation", also used for
    denoting various ad hoc relations (for example, for denoting "witnessing"
    in the context of Rosser's trick) See here for an image of glyph. Added to
    Unicode 3.2.0.
